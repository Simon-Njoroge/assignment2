                    I am an enthusiastic Computer Scientist and a Full Stack Web Developer, passionate about creating
                    innovative web applications and solving complex problems with code. With expertise in various modern

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="about">
                    I am a third-year student pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a passionate
                    full-stack web developer with one year of experience. Currently, I am enhancing my skills by taking a
                    professional development course at Aspire Institute. I am honored to serve as a Uniport Loans
                    Students Ambassador, the President of the Rotaract Club of Kirinyaga University, and the website
                    coordinator for Kirinyaga University Christian Union. Outside of coding, I enjoy reading books to
                    improve my communication skills and love traveling to experience new environments and cultures.
